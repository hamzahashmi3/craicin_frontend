                <h4 className='mt-5'>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This access statement aims to describe our services.</p>
                <p>So we can ensure you're comfortable travelling with us, please let us know about any special requirements before you book your trip. You can also ask us about specific itineraries at <a href="mailto:tours@rabbies.com" className='text-success'>tours@rabbies.com</a>.</p>
                <p>It's essential you give us prior notice if you're bringing a wheelchair, a mobility aid, or need an accessible room.</p>

                <h4>Our Mini-coaches</h4>
                <p>All our tours in the UK are operated in 16 seat Mercedes Mini-coaches. The Irish tours and Europe tours use different makes of coach, but they’re similar in layout and facilities. There are no toilets on any of our buses.</p>
                <p>Entry and exit from the mini-coaches is via the front left passenger door. There are three steps up into the coach – each 150mm in height. There are grab handles on both sides, the step edges are clearly marked and the treads are non-slip.</p>
                <p>The seats are on-level standard coach seats with a step up to the back row of seats.</p>
                <p>The seat configuration is single seats on the passenger side and double seats on the driver’s side. All seats have full three-point seatbelts which must be worn when the vehicle is moving. Seat belt extenders are available if required.</p>
                <p>Booster seats for smaller children are also available if required – we should be notified in advance of any children under 1.2m in height who would require a booster seat.</p>
                <p>Our buses are not wheelchair accessible, however we have large luggage compartments which may easily take a folding wheelchair or walking frame. Our staff are not able to offer physical assistance when boarding or disembarking from the buses or at any point during the tour. Guests should be comfortable getting on and off the bus on their own or with the assistance of a travelling companion.</p>

                <h4>Departure Points</h4>
                <p>Our departure points are located on public roads, bus stations, train stations and hotels. For more information, see our <Link to="#" className="text-success">departure points</Link> page.</p>

                <h4>Check-In</h4>
                <p>Our departure points have different check-in methods. Please <Link to="#" className='text-success'>contact us</Link> to find out specific information about a departure point.</p>

                <h5>Rabbie's Café</h5>
                <p>The main access to the café has three steps each 140 mm in height and a 1050 mm wide swing door opening inwards. We do not have ramp access. There are no internal steps.</p>
                <p>Easier access (one step of 120 mm in height) is available through our office entrance round the corner to the left. Please press the buzzer labelled Rabbie’s for assistance (buzzer height 1400 mm). While the office entrance door is 900 mm wide the internal access doors (original features so not something we can change) are 750 mm wide.</p>
                <p>The interior of the café has a mix of high (1080 mm clearance) and low (680 mm clearance) tables and a variety of fixed and moveable seating. There is space to move furniture around and to accommodate wheelchair users. Please ask the café staff to assist.</p>
                <p>The self-service counter is at 900 mm height but we also offer table service if required. Most of our food is freshly prepared. For food allergy and special dietary requirements please ask our café staff for advice. The service counter has a hearing loop system installed.</p>
                <p>The café has a unisex accessible public toilet with movement sensor activated lighting, grab rails, lever tap, low toilet and sink and emergency alarm cord. The floor surface is rough tile.</p>

                <h4>Commentary & Language</h4>
                <p>All tours are guided by an English-speaking live guide, with one exception – we do offer a separate version of our Loch Ness Day tour led by a Mandarin-speaking live guide.</p>
                <p>We do not supply any written information about the tours. Our website provides tour summaries in French, Spanish, German, Italian and Mandarin, which you may print for your convenience.</p>
                <p>Safety instructions will be given verbally by the driver-guide before departure. If anything is unclear, please bring this to their attention. The driver/guide will generally use a microphone and there are speakers throughout the vehicle</p>
                <p>There are regular stops during the tour during which the driver-guides will be happy to answer any questions and repeat any information you may have missed.</p>
                
                <h4>Tour Stops</h4>
                <p>We make regular comfort breaks throughout the day – normally there would be no more than 1.5 - 2 hours between stops with toilet facilities. Because these facilities are operated by 3rd parties, some public, some private - we cannot be specific about the accessibility of each stop, but in most places fully accessible toilets are available.</p>
                <p>Our tours are designed to have lots of stops with as much time off the bus as possible. Most tours include visits to attractions of various types: photo opportunities, refreshment breaks, historical sights, old towns, and nature walks.</p>
                <p>Some of our tours involve fewer activities and are more accessible than others; get in touch, and we can help you decide.</p>

                <h4>Accommodation on Multi-day Tours</h4>
                <p>We offer flexible accommodation options on our UK & Ireland tours and don’t accommodate our tour groups together in the same property. Groups are split between a variety of B&Bs, Hotels and Hostels to suit preferences indicated at the time of booking. As each accommodation provider has a different level of accessibility, it not possible to give specific access details here.</p>
                <p>We endeavour to accommodate all passengers as close to local facilities as possible. Hotels and Hostels tend to be centrally located and B&Bs tend to be in residential areas on the outskirts of towns/villages. In all cases, passengers should be aware that accommodation may be up to a 30-minute walk (approximately 1.4 miles) away from local facilities. Taxis are available in all locations and can be booked and paid locally.</p>
                <p>Lifts and elevators are uncommon but may be available in some Hotels. Ground floor rooms are available in many B&Bs and Hotels. If either is essential, please let us know at the time of booking.</p>
                <p>Any additional mobility and special requirements (dietary, allergy etc.) should be made clear at the time of booking, so we can ensure the most appropriate accommodation is allocated to you.</p>
                <p>If you’d rather book your own accommodation, please let us know at the time of booking and ensure reservations are made within two miles of the specified overnight town-centre.</p>
                <p>You can contact rooms@rabbies.com for further information and advice on accommodation.</p>
