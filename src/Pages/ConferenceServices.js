                            <h4>Edinburgh Afternoon Tea</h4>
                            <p>Tea consumption increased dramatically during the early nineteenth century and it is around this time that Anna, 7th Duchess of Bedford, is said to have complained of having that ‘sinking feeling’ during the late afternoon. The solution for the Duchess was a pot of tea and a light snack, taken privately in her boudoir during the afternoon. Later friends were invited to join her and this summer practice proved so popular that the Duchess sent cards to her friends asking them to join her for ‘Afternoon Tea’. Other society hostesses quickly picked up on the idea and the practice became respectable enough to move it into the drawing room. Before long fashionable society was sipping tea and nibbling sandwiches in the middle of the afternoon.</p>

                            <p>The guests will be collected from the hotel by executive coach and fully qualified guide. From here we make our way to Loch Lomond.

Cruise under the shadow of Ben Lomond, Scotland’s most southerly Munro (3192ft). Enjoy a cup of tea or coffee whilst listening to an informative, live commentary on the history of the feuding clans, pillaging Vikings & see Rob Roy Macgregor’s Prison. From here we continue to Glengoyne Distillery. History records the distillery as 'Burnfoot of Glenguin' in 1836. At this charming distillery guests will be able to see the malting, mashing, fermentation, distilling and maturation process which is involved in making the ‘Water of Life’. You will be greeted on arrival by a piper and a welcome dram before enjoying a full guided tour of the distillery. After the tour you will enjoy a four course dinner with each course paired with a different whisky before being returned to your hotel.</p>

                            <p>We held our end of year company conference in the Burns Room at Craicin and were extremely impressed by the service we received. With around 28 people, including our executive board from London, we were provided with a great meeting room with a huge TV screen for presentations, constantly replenished coffee/tea station and a cracking view of Edinburgh's Princes Street. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful even when we had some minor technical difficulties with our laptops and presentations! All in all a great venue for meetings and corporate events and located just a stones throw from Waverley Station. Highly recommended."</p>

                            <p>"Craicin were efficient at both events we were hosting in their upstairs venue. The location is central and excellent. The room is bright and spacious with an amazing view down the length of Princes Street. Locals were impressed, non-locals even more so. The full "room height" Georgian windows lend the room class beyond the price."</p>

                            <p>"Scottish Enterprise used the Board room within Rabbie’s offices at 6 Waterloo Place for a 2 day team development workshop. The facilities were perfect for our group (up to 20 pax) and the central location (2 minutes walk from Waverly station) was ideal. The room layout and facilities allowed for a comfortable & relaxed working environment. All catering (lunches and morning & afternoon snacks) were delicious. The food was obviously home made on the premises and lunch in particular received high praise (from our normally picky team). The food was fresh, tasty and a lovely change from typical business lunch offerings. We’d have no hesitation in using the venue again, and have already recommended it to colleagues."</p>
